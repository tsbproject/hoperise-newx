                                        <p class="about-main__text">HopeRise Charity is more than just an organization; 
                                            it is a heartfelt mission, a divine calling to spread the Love of Christ to 
                                            humanity every single day. Our story began many years ago, rooted in the 
                                            compassionate actions of our founder, Folasade A.O. Sowunmi, who was deeply 
                                            inspired by her father’s unwavering generosity. From the tender age of 14, 
                                            Folasade witnessed her father give selflessly to those who had nothing—no 
                                            food, no clothing, no shelter. His daily acts of kindness, meeting the needs 
                                            of strangers, became a powerful lesson in compassion and service.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="about-main__text">Growing up in a home where cooking for and accommodating
                                             strangers was a daily routine, Folasade’s heart was shaped by these experiences.
                                              She developed a profound passion to help those in need, driven by the grace of God. 
                                              Over the years, she has engaged in countless acts of charity, often without records
                                               or photos, building lasting relationships with those she has helped. Many of these 
                                               individuals remain a part of her life, bearing testimony to the impact of her compassion.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="about-main__text">The plight of the needy, the impoverished, and the homeless often 
                                            keeps Folasade awake at night, bringing her to tears. Despite doing all she can within her
                                             means, she knows there is always more to be done. This is where HopeRise Charity steps in,
                                              calling upon the world to join hands in this noble cause. Together, with other organizations, 
                                              individuals, groups, government agencies, private and public companies, churches, and anyone 
                                              willing to share even the smallest contribution, we can transform lives and communities.
                                        </p>
